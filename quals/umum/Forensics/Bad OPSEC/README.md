## Description
I should've checked the domain is not from `kaspersky.com` but it's from `kasperky.com`. I'm calling you now to help me investigate since I'm too paranoid and there's this silly process AV that I accidentally run (of course) so I dump it for you to analyze.

Please do answer all the questions on the remote connection. There are only 5 Questions for you to answer, which is nice!
