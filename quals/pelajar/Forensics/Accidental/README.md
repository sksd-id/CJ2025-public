## Description

While I'm playing along with my `pyftpdlib` to debug my localhost FTP and switched along bidirectional host with other tool, yet it looks like I accidentally leaked one of the SSH password that I forgets to clear in my terminal. I'm doomed!

The flag can be found from what I try to download from FTP and also combined with the leaked SSH password.
